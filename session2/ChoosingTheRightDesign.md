### **Exercise 3: Choosing the Right Design (Microservice, Monolith, or Modular Monolith)**

*Duration: Approximately 60 minutes*

**What you'll get out of this exercise:**

Develop critical thinking on when to choose a microservices architecture, a traditional monolith, or a modular monolith (majestic monolith) based on specific business and technical requirements.

**Instructions Part 1 (Individually):**

1. **Understand the Scenarios (10 minutes):**

   - **Scenario 1:** A startup developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a new social media platform with limited resources and a tight deadline.
   - **Scenario 2:** An established e-commerce company experiencing performance issues due to increased traffic and looking to improve scalability.
   - **Scenario 3:** A financial institution requiring strict data consistency and dealing with complex transactions.

2. **Define Architecture Options:**

   - **Monolithic Architecture:**
     - Single unified codebase and deployment unit.
   - **Microservices Architecture:**
     - Multiple independent services communicating over APIs.
   - **Modular Monolith (Majestic Monolith):**
     - A monolithic deployment unit with a well-organized, modular internal structure.

**Instructions Part 2 (Subgroup):**

3. **Evaluate Each Scenario (30 minutes):**

   - **For Each Scenario:**
     - **Identify Business and Technical Requirements:**
       - Time-to-market, scalability, maintainability, team size, expertise, regulatory compliance.
     - **Assess Pros and Cons of Each Architecture:**
       - **Monolith:**
         - Pros: Simplicity, easier to develop initially.
         - Cons: Scalability limitations, deployment challenges.
       - **Microservices:**
         - Pros: Scalability, independent deployment.
         - Cons: Complexity, requires more infrastructure.
       - **Modular Monolith:**
         - Pros: Organized codebase, simpler deployment than microservices.
         - Cons: May not scale as well as microservices.
     - **Make a Recommendation:**
       - Choose the most suitable architecture.
       - Justify your choice based on the scenario's requirements.

4. **Discuss and Report Design Principles and Considerations (15 minutes):**

   - **Consider Containerization:**
     - How containerization applies to each architecture.
     - Note that while common, it's not necessary for monoliths or microservices.
   - **Factor in the Twelve-Factor App Principles:**
     - How adherence to these principles impacts your architectural choice.
   - **Reflect on Transition Strategies:**
     - If starting with a monolith, how to plan for potential future migration to microservices.
   - **Prepare to Present your Report in the Main Room:**
     - You can use diagrams, slide tools or a plain google doc that includes your report. Make sure to have written down considerations for each choice.

**Instructions Part 3 (Back in the Main Room):**

5. **Present Your Recommendations (15 minutes):**

   - **Each Group Presents:**
     - Summarize your evaluation for each scenario.
     - Explain your recommended architecture and reasoning.

6. **Group Discussion (10 minutes):**

   - **Compare Choices:**
     - Discuss differences in recommendations.
     - Explore the reasoning behind different choices.

7. **Reflection and Documentation (Final 5 minutes):**

   - **Summarize Learnings:**
     - Write down key factors influencing architectural decisions.
     - Note any insights gained from other groups' perspectives.
